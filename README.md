**U.S. Industrial Emissions Visualization Dashboard**
Welcome to the "U.S. Industrial Emissions Visualization Dashboard" project! This repository hosts a dynamic Tableau dashboard that delves into industrial emissions in the United States, with a comprehensive analysis of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and Methane (CH4) emissions.

**Project Overview**
Our Tableau dashboard offers an engaging exploration of environmental data, providing insights into emissions of CO2, NO2, and CH4 from various industrial sources. We aim to empower policymakers, environmental agencies, and researchers with valuable information to drive environmental sustainability.

**Key Visualizations**
Highest CO2 Emissions by City: Our interactive map visualization pinpoints the cities with the highest CO2 emissions. Notably, Juliette emerges as the location with the most significant CO2 emissions, providing valuable insights for policymakers to address environmental concerns.

Emissions by Different Gases: Explore the distribution of emissions for CO2, NO2, and CH4 to understand the environmental impact of each gas in various regions.

Top 5 Emitting Industries: Identify the industrial sectors responsible for the highest emissions of CO2, NO2, and CH4, offering crucial insights into potential areas for regulation and improvement.

Total Reported Direct Emissions by Industry: Gain an overview of total reported direct emissions within each industry, facilitating targeted efforts to mitigate environmental impact.

Emissions Over Time: This dynamic visualization tracks emissions over time, revealing trends and changes in industrial emissions patterns.
